## üöÄ Installation / Setup

#### ‚åö Installing Requirements
Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/iGameCreep/Discord-BOT-Panel/releases), open up the root directory and run the following command.

```

#### üñ•Ô∏è Setting up BOT
Rename ``config.default.js`` to ``config.js`` and open up the file, then input the required fields. 
```js
module.exports = {
    token: "",
    clientID: "",
    secret: "",
    admins: ["696753471650660412"],
    port: "3000",
    session: "",
    theme: "default.css",
    ver: "1",
    callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/login/api"
}
```

**Token** : Your bot token. Can be found in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), on the page of your application.

**ClientID** : Your bot ID. In your discord settings, go to Advanced, and enable Developer Mode. Then, right-click on your bot profile and click **Copy ID**.

**Secret** : Your bot secret. Can be found in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), on the page of your application.

**Admins** : The IDs of the users that are allowed to connect. You can put your ID that can be found the same way that with your bot ID, but you have to click on your profile.

**Port** : The port the server will be running on. Default is set to 3000.

**Domain** : The domain / IP you are running the panel on. If you are running it on your PC, you can let it like this.

**Session** : 32 random characters, with numbers and lowercase letters.

**Theme** : The basic theme for the panel. You can let it like this.

**Ver** : The version of the Panel. Right now, it's on v1, so don't change it.

**Callback URL** : The callback URL. Should be *http://DOMAIN:PORT/login/api*

Make sure to enable both "Privileged Gateway Intents" and to add as a **Redirect** the Callback URL ( replace DOMAIN with your domain / IP and PORT with the port you're running on. If you didn't edited domain and port in config, enter *"http://localhost:3000/login/api"* ) on the [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers).

#### üì° Starting the application 
Open up the root directory and run the following command.
```bash
node main.js
